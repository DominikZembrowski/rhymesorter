In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down

I'm tryna do more with her than do a feature (do it)
I checked the web, they out here chewin' me up,  it
In my past, bittersweet, there's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams
lonely times in deed
With eyes cast down eyes cast
Fadeaway, I lift that Luka knee up, bucket
I heard from someone you said you could be us, nothing

You know my city like the new Korea, bustin
All these discussions over who could see us, hush it

I sold them basements out, let's do arenas, crushing
She looking, I'm blushing, I'm lying, I'm touching

Rain, rain, rain, rain
I need this  to be tooken up, I got accustomed to it
 a leap of faith, I took a jump just like it's nothing to it
In my life I have seen people walk into the sea

Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Girl, them Russian twists is working, now just put your butt into it
In my past, bittersweet the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams, lonely times in deed

With eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground, with eyes cast

All that talk, I'm cutting through it
I ain't no connoisseur, but I like this kind of store
I got nothing to do with who the  they think I'm screwing
Uh, nine times out of ten I had 'em, then I blew it, but I need some
Dua Lipa, I'm tryna do more with her than do a feature (do it)
In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery


I checked the web, they out here chewin' me up,  it
Fadeaway, I lift that Luka knee up, bucket

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

I heard from someone you said you could be us, nothing

I ain't no like this kind of store
I got nothing to do with who I'm screwing
Uh, nine times out of ten I had 'em, then I blew it, but I need some

You know my city like the new Korea, bustin

All these discussions over who could see us, hush it
I sold them basements out, let's do arenas, crushin

I ain't no connoisseur, but I like this kind of store
I got nothing to do with who the  they think I'm screwing
Uh, nine times out of ten I had 'em, then I blew it, but I need some

She looking, I'm blushing, I'm lying, I'm touching

EJ turnt these ' pecks up
Need somethin', I hit my connects up
I get like three somethin' every time I dress up
I told Yeezus that I got a confession

If I could write to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my hope that you like this

But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me
We 'bout to be somethin', they gon' have to catch up
