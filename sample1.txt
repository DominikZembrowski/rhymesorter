I can see it in your eyes
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
Got them browns of hash
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to crime
Hear my plight
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Moving like a mime
Tell me what is in your sight
Taste like a lime
'Cause they never tell me lies
We don't ever have to fight
