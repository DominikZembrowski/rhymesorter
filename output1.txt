And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to crime
Moving like a mime
Taste like a lime

Hear my plight
Tell me what is in your sight
We don't ever have to fight

I can see it in your eyes
'Cause they never tell me lies

I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe

Got them browns of hash

You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
